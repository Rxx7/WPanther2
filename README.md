# Panther
A Spigot library with multiple features to speed up development.

## How can I use it?

You don't. This is a private library and the source code is fully reserved by me.
It is bundled with all my plugins as of 17th July 2017. It is also used by private networks operated by myself.

## Why is it open source if its private?

This is an example of my work, you're more than welcome to look around however _I will not be accepting pull requests_.
